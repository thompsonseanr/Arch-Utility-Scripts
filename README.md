# Arch-Utility-Scripts

These are simple scripts written primarily for whenever I am performing Arch upgrades.

**makebak:** script for making an lvm snapshot of my root directory prior to major upgrades.

**deletebak:** script for deleting lvm snapshot.

**mergebak:** uh-oh, something happened during the upgrade and I need to roll back. This also works for those times you have to boot via arch usb and arch-chroot.

**journal_error_log:** Optimized error log to check errors after upgrades.
